# differences-between-2-files-asm
This is an assembly program which compares two files and outputs the differences and the file position where the differences were found in to another file.
The program gets the two source file names and the destination file name from the user through program parameters.
The file names must be entered in a specific format: [file1].txt [file2].txt [result].txt.
If one file is bigger than the other i.e. there is more symbols on one file, the program will output ' ' as the difference.

This program wasn't written very efficiently but it will get the job done :).
